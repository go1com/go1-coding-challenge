Learners and Courses
====================

Learners are people using Go1 to learn something. Courses are videos, quizzes, interactive experiences, etc. 

For this challenge, the dataset contains a map of LearnerIds and a list of CourseIds that the Learner's have completed.

We'd like to know about courses that have only been completed by a single learner.

Return a list of CourseId's that have only been completed by 1 Learner.

For example:
```json
["Course-0001", "Course-0009"]
```
